1. There are 4 categories. One will be chosen at random. You know the category. But you have to guess the name.
2. If you fail 6 times, you will lose the game. If you guess the word, you win.
3. Reset the game to replay or click quit to close.
4. You can modify the data.txt and change the categories (first word of each line) and words as you like.
5. Enjoy the game!
